[from Secrets import username, password](https://github.com/mahadi0007/facebook_post_data_scrub_and_store_data_in_CSV_file/blob/master/.ipynb_checkpoints/facebook%20data%20scrubber-checkpoint.ipynb)

This line will give error.
To solve this you have to write **username** and **password** in a file called **Secrets** and store that in module,
  * username = "your own username"
  * password = "your own password"
